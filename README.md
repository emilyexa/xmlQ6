write in Qt6 xml dialect

instead of writing your gui in pure C or cry to figure out how does Qt Creator works. xmlQt6 will bring back using a dialect of xml that Qt Creator only lets you watch the xml and developers didn't go for it using this app you can using the good MVC. GUI Desing will be in the Qt6 xml dialect with the side by side of the preview of what you write and then thanks to the xml dialect the functions of the desinged interface will be available to write only the relative code. for example a quit button as written in C/C++ thanks to logic that glue model will proved the functinon on the quit button even though it was though it had no function, thaks to the logic part of MVC prgramming desing will carry the function of the button that wast develped and in the end result, the quit button will immediately exit the program.
